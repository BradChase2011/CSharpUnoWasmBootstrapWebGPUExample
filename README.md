# CSharpUnoWasmBootstrapWebGPUExample
A simple C#, WebGPU, Uno.Wasm.Bootstrap example that shows a triangle.

*** CURRENTLY NOT WORKING, THIS IS A TESTING REPOSITORY AS OF YET ***
*** THE EXAMPLE BREAKS ON BLITTABLE TYPES AND MISSING ASSEMBLY    ***

This was created because I could not find a simple all inclusive example of running WebGPU in Uno.Wasm.Bootstrap utilizing C#.
It currently only supports .NET 8.

This takes heavily and could not have been done without two great repository examples:

	https://github.com/yowl/CSharpWebGpu
	https://github.com/juj/wasm_webgpu

I highly suggest you check them out!
